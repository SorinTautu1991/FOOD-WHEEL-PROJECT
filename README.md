# FOOD-WHEEL-PROJECT
This repository contains my project developed for obtaining the completion certificate as a Java software developer at Informal School of It 2021.
This project`s development took 2 months of hard work, considering the fact that I started to learn to program, six months ago. Everything started from a simple idea of random recipe generation based on some database entries and soon developed into multiple functionalities.
Food Wheel has the following functionalities:
1. Login and register for new users;
2. Simple search functionality for recipes by name;
3. Autocomplete search for recipes names and ingredients;
4. Help section for new users;
5. Add new recipes;
6. Filters for your searches;
7. Search recipes by ingredients you already have on your fridge;
8. A funny feature, where you can spin the wheel and get a random recipe generated, for users that really don`t have any idea what can they cook or order;
9. Users can add recipes to their favourites; 
10. Users can generate shopping lists based on recipes they like. These shopping lists can be downloaded or printed;
11. Every recipe has nutritional information;
12. Funny advices for users regarding nutrition and food;
The project was build using several technologies like:
- Java for backend;
- Javascript, Jquerry, Css, Html for frontend 
- The app was deployed to a Cloud Platform As A Service called Heroku, that provides some add-ons like Postgresql database, and Cloudinary add-on for dealing with image storage and transformations.
- In order to extract name of ingredients and nutritional values for them from a string, I used an api from NutritionIx, that uses natural language extraction of ingredients and knows how to calculate nutritional information for each;
